This folder contains pre-computed unsupervised topic vectors for each dataset. 
They are read in as an initalization point for cslda.

To create cached topics in the current directory for each dataset:
./ssh_submit.py -n potatoes -r . -o /tmp/outtopics

WARNING: these topic vectors are not usable by the code because they depend on instances being ordered in a way that's determined by --data-seed. Either we need to run one per data-seed or else store them as a map from data source to topic vector.
