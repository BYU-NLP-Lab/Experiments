This repo is a place for developing and archiving 
the code necessary to use archived jars 
to reproduce previous results. The intent is that anybody in 
the future at any time can clone this repo, find the 
folder corresponding to the paper they are interested in, 
and follow the directions there to exactly reproduce the 
results reported in that paper. 

folder structure:
  [username]/: a folder for ongoing development by username 
    (a good place for work in progress, failed paper submissions, etc.)
  [papername]/: an archival set of experiments/scripts corresponding
    to papers that have been published. 

Good to commit:
* READMEs explaining a manual pipeline of scripts to run
* experiment driver scripts
* result collections scripts
* plotting scripts
* parsimonious csv files summarizing important published results

Bad to commit:
* large files
* dependencies on jars or projects that are not archived 
  in our maven repo. 
* raw results or log files.
