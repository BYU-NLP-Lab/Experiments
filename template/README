These folders contain driver scripts and plotting scripts.
In general, these scripts assume that before running them you 
have done: 
`mvn clean dependencies:copy-dependencies package`
That will transitively download all of the libraries that your 
pom file depends on into the target/dependency/ folder.

Each archival paper folder should contain an explanation of what it is doing and 
which paper(s) it contributed to.
